# FL-EndoViT
This study introduces a federated learning approach for training surgical foundation models without data sharing. By adapting EndoViT with Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Stochastic Weight Averaging, we achieve performance comparable to centralized models across key surgical tasks while preserving privacy.
